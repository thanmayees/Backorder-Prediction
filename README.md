# Backorder-Prediction

Abstract

Predicting backorders is efficient inventory management and supply chain optimization, leading to cost reduction and improved customer satisfaction. The project aims to develop a robust backorder prediction model using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. By combining these models which helps in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of predictions. The model is trained on a detailed dataset comprising inventory and sales data, analyzing historical sales and inventory to uncover patterns associated with backorders. The Key features include forecasted demand, inventory levels, lead times, and sales performance. Each algorithm contributes unique strengths such has logistic regression for binary classification, decision trees for understandability and random forests for improved accuracy. Adding ROC-AUC Curve analysis provides deeper insights into model performance. Combining predictions from all models enhances overall performance, enabling businesses to manage inventory effectively, predict backorders, and take preventive strategies such as adjusting inventory levels or expediting shipment. The model provides a valuable tool for optimizing inventory and enhancing operational efficiency.
